# Tweight - User Stories

**Purpose:** Granular user stories for detailed task tracking (if needed)

**Status:** Not used yet - KISS approach with use cases first

---

## 📁 When to Use This

**Use Cases (usecases/)** are usually enough.

**Use Stories (this folder)** when:
- A use case is too large and needs breakdown
- Multiple developers need task-level coordination
- Sprint planning requires granular tracking

**For now:** Keep it simple with use cases only.

## 💡 Philosophy

**Don't over-organize before you need to.**

Start with use cases. Add stories if complexity demands it.

YAGNI applies to project management too. 😊
