# Contributing to ChrisBuilds64

First off, thank you for considering contributing! 🙏

This is a **Building in Public** project, which means the entire development process is transparent and community-driven.

## How You Can Contribute

### 1. Use the Code & Give Feedback

- Try the code in your own projects
- Share your experience (what worked, what didn't)
- Report bugs or unexpected behavior
- Suggest improvements

### 2. Share & Attribution

If you use this code:
- ⭐ Star the repo (helps others find it)
- 🔗 Link back to this repository
- 📝 Mention [@ChrisBuilds64](https://github.com/chrisbuilds64) if you share your project
- 💬 Share your learnings (blog post, tweet, video)

**This helps the community grow!**

### 3. Code Contributions

**Before submitting a PR:**
1. Read [ARCHITECTURE.md](ARCHITECTURE.md) to understand the vision
2. Check [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/chrisbuilds64/control/blob/main/CLAUDE.md) for development principles
3. Follow the **KISS principle** - simple solutions over "proper" architecture
4. Focus on **Use Cases** (UC-XXX format)

**PR Guidelines:**
- One feature/fix per PR
- Include tests if applicable
- Update documentation
- Follow existing code style
- Explain **why**, not just **what**

### 4. Documentation

Documentation is just as important as code:
- Fix typos or unclear explanations
- Add examples or use cases
- Translate to other languages
- Create tutorials or guides

### 5. Community Support

- Answer questions in Issues or Discussions
- Share your own solutions to common problems
- Help newcomers get started
- Spread the word about the project

## Development Principles

This project follows specific principles (see [CLAUDE.md](https://github.com/chrisbuilds64/control/blob/main/CLAUDE.md)):

- **KISS** - Keep It Simple, Stupid
- **YAGNI** - You Aren't Gonna Need It
- **Use Case Driven** - Real problems, real solutions
- **Ship > Perfect** - Working code beats perfect plans

## Bug Reports

**Good bug reports include:**
- Clear description of the problem
- Steps to reproduce
- Expected vs actual behavior
- Your environment (OS, Python/Flutter version, etc.)
- Relevant logs or screenshots

## Feature Requests

**Good feature requests:**
- Describe the **problem** you're trying to solve
- Explain **why** this feature would be valuable
- Consider if it fits the project's scope (productivity apps)
- Accept that not every feature will be implemented (YAGNI!)

Be respectful, constructive, and kind. We're all learning together.

**This is a learning project.** Mistakes are part of the process. Perfect code is not the goal—shipping and learning is.
