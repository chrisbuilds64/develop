# tweight - Capture. Organize. Focus.

## The Problem

Your brain is full of ideas, tasks, and things you don't want to forget. But capturing them is friction. Opening an app, creating a new entry, filling out forms - by the time you're done, the thought is gone.

## The Solution

**tweight** is a minimalist capture tool that gets out of your way.

Wake up with three ideas? Tap one button, dictate or type them line by line, done. Each becomes a tagged item in your inbox, ready to process later.

## Key Features

### Quick Capture
One tap. Multiple lines. Each line becomes an item tagged "inbox". Zero friction brain dump.

### Smart Tag System
- Filter your items by tags
- Tag picker with search
- Combine multiple tags
- Create new tags on the fly

### Two Views
- **Card View**: Full context with tags and metadata
- **Text View**: Clean, document-style list for focused review

### Search
Case-insensitive full-text search across all your items. Find anything instantly.

### Sync
Your data lives on your own server. Access from anywhere. Own your data.

## Philosophy

**KISS - Keep It Simple, Stupid**

tweight doesn't try to be everything. No complex project management. No AI prioritization. No gamification.

Just capture, organize, focus.

The features that aren't there are intentional. Every feature we didn't build is complexity you don't have to manage.
