# Code of Conduct

## Our Pledge

This is a **Building in Public** project. We're all learning together.

We pledge to make participation in this project a welcoming, respectful, and harassment-free experience for everyone—regardless of age, body size, disability, ethnicity, gender identity, experience level, nationality, personal appearance, race, religion, or sexual orientation.

## Our Standards

**Positive behavior includes:**

- Being respectful and constructive in feedback
- Accepting constructive criticism gracefully
- Focusing on what's best for the community and the learning process
- Showing empathy and kindness toward others
- Sharing knowledge and helping newcomers
- Acknowledging that we're all learning (even with 40 years of experience!)

**Unacceptable behavior includes:**

- Harassment, trolling, or insulting comments
- Personal or political attacks
- Publishing others' private information
- Unwelcome sexual attention or advances
- Any conduct that would be inappropriate in a professional setting

## Building in Public Means

- **Transparency:** Showing the process, including failures and mistakes
- **Learning Together:** No question is too basic, no mistake too embarrassing
- **Constructive Feedback:** Critique the code/idea, not the person
- **Experimentation:** This is a hobby project—perfection is not the goal

## Scope

This Code of Conduct applies within all project spaces (GitHub, Discussions, Issues, PRs) and when representing the project in public spaces.

## Enforcement

Instances of unacceptable behavior may be reported to [@ChrisBuilds64](https://github.com/chrisbuilds64).

All complaints will be reviewed and investigated promptly and fairly.

Project maintainers have the right to remove, edit, or reject comments, commits, code, issues, and other contributions that don't align with this Code of Conduct.

## Attribution

This Code of Conduct is adapted from the [Contributor Covenant](https://www.contributor-covenant.org/), version 2.1.

## Remember

We're all here to learn, build, and share. Be kind. Be constructive. Be excellent to each other.

**This is a learning project. Mistakes are expected. Growth is the goal.**
